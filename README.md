# WAVIO
WAV File (*.wav) reader/writer library written in C.

## Note
[WAVIO](https://github.com/AUDIY/WAVIO) is no longer maintained and will be archived soon.  
This library is developped to make me understood about WAV file structure.  
If you want to read & write audio files including WAV file, It is recommended to use [libsndfile](https://libsndfile.github.io/libsndfile/).
